Callback function is nothing more than a function that is passed to another function. In python they are called higher order functions

Object references and clone - study more on this

```console
console.log({} === {})
\\false
```
Two objects are equal if they are in the same object memory. 

```javascript
let someObject = {}
let otherObject = someObject

console.log(someObject === otherObject)
\\true
```
indexOf works with strings, booleans and numbers but if the array contains objects it is better to use findindex function

this is not bound to arrow function

## Javascript Data storage
Able to perform CRUD operations
